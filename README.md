Project Overview
The Generative AI Research Navigator is designed to streamline the process of extracting and analyzing information from news articles. By leveraging technologies such as FAISS, LangChain, and Meta Llama 3.2, this tool provides users with a sophisticated platform for conducting in-depth research and gaining valuable insights.

Features
Data Loading: Load and process data from multiple news article URLs.
Text Splitting: Efficiently split the content into manageable chunks for analysis.
Embeddings and Vector Indexing: Generate embeddings and create a FAISS vector index for efficient data retrieval.
Question Answering: Retrieve answers to user queries based on the processed data.
Source Citation: Provide sources for the retrieved answers, ensuring transparency and reliability.
Technologies Used
LangChain: For managing large language models and chains.
FAISS: For efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
OpenAI: For generating text embeddings and processing queries.
Streamlit: For creating an interactive user interface.
Unstructured: For loading and processing unstructured data from URLs.
Python Libraries: Such as dotenv, pickle, and faiss-cpu.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/abdulghaffaransari/Generative-AI-Research-Navigator.git
cd Generative-AI-Research-Navigator
Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
Usage
To use the Generative AI Research Navigator, follow these steps:

Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run main.py
Enter URLs: In the sidebar, enter up to three news article URLs you want to process.

Process URLs: Click the "Process URLs" button to start loading and processing the data.

Ask Questions: Enter your questions in the main input field to retrieve answers based on the processed data.

Workflow
The workflow of the Generative AI Research Navigator is as follows:

Load Data:

Use UnstructuredURLLoader to load content from the provided URLs.
Display a progress message to keep users informed.
Split Text:

Use RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to split the loaded data into manageable chunks.
Create Embeddings:

Generate embeddings for the text chunks using OpenAIEmbeddings.
Build FAISS Index:

Create a FAISS vector index from the document embeddings.
Save the index and related data to files for future use.
Query Processing:

Load the FAISS index and related data when a user enters a query.
Use RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain to process the query and retrieve answers.
Display the answer and sources to the user.
